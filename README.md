## [Description](#table-of-contents)

Back end for an e-commerce site with an express.js API and using sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

Add a .env file to the root of the app with the following details:

- DB_NAME='database name'
- DB_USER='your username'
- DB_PW='your password'

Then run 'npm install' in the terminal, run 'npm run seed' and finally 'npm start'.

## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file

THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize

WHEN I enter schema and seed commands

THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application

THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags

THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core

THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

Here is a video demoing how this app works:
